## Hey I'm Ronexiaz,
I'm just a guy who likes Java and Python. I just graduated with a degree in comp sci. This is my personal profile, not my professional one. Past school projects, personal, non-resume projects will go here.

I'm Ronexiaz on almost everything btw, if you ever want to scream at me, you can usually find me under that name.
